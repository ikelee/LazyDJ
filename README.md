# LazyDJ
Project to use pre-organized library of WAV files of stems to create a new song or playlist of songs, fully equipped with smooth transitions, musical shifts, etc. 

Project started on Oct 22, 2017. Minimum viable product distribution will tentatively start on Dec 31, 2017. 

Project will use: 
  Python 2.7.14
  pyAudioAnalysis
  Aubio
  sciPy (specifically numPy)
  ffmPeg
  Docker (for containerization later)
  
Estimated timeline: 
  Oct 22, 2017: Start project, create outlines, workflow and schedule. 
  Oct 29, 2017: Have some solution to beat detection, pitch shift and audio rendering
  Nov 5,  2017: Be able to take predetermined stems and turn it into one song (single song)
  Nov 12, 2017: Be able to have a solution to finding which samples will work together
  Nov 19, 2017: Key switch determination algorithm in place 
  --To be determined as project progressed--
  
This project is currently halted in production. Update will come soon

Will be using this Git library as a primary source of version control, will ensure transparent progression of the project by avoiding rewriting history on master (with the exception of squashing small fix commits), and using feature branches and pull requests.
