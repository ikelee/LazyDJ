Process Chain for LazyDJ 

1. Full analysis, metadata extraction
2. Beat/Pitch detection 
3. Path determintation, optimal tempo/key/pitch determination
4. Render
5. Display(?)

Full analysis: 
	madmom library -> beat detection using RNNDownBeatDetection, create numPy array of the matrix of downbeats 
	metadata extraction -> librosa(?), used for pitch determination? 
		- Consider other resources, as these options are okay at best
